Task

One of the main problems that spawned the invention of Calculus was that of finding the area of a
region under a curve defined by a function, such as f(x) = x^2 and f(x) = x^0.5+1

One way to estimate such an area is to divide it into rectangular subregions, with either the left or right endpoint being equal to the
value of the function. The area of the region is found by summing the areas of all the rectangular
subregions. In a function that grows positively, if the left endpoint is used, then the sum of the
rectangles must be less than the true area, and is thus called the lower sum. Conversely, if the
right endpoint is used, the sum is greater than the true area and is therefore called the upper
sum. A good estimate for the true area can be found if the upper sum is “close to” the lower sum.
The values are “close to” one another if their difference is less than or equal to some value, defined
as ǫ. The upper and lower sums converge as the number of intervals, i.e., the number of rectangles,
increases.

You are to write a program that will find a good estimate of the area of a region beneath two
different functions: f(x) = x^2 and f(x) = x^0.5+1

Call these functions 1 and 2, respectively
