Output

- The program should display the minimum number of intervals needed such that the difference
between the upper and lower sums is less than or equal to ǫ. If the region has been divided into
more than 2000 intervals and the sum is still not within ǫ, a message to that effect should be
displayed. In either case, the two sums should be displayed.
