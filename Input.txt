Input

- The program should display a short menu showing the 2 choices for functions and choice 3 to quit.

- The program should then prompt the user for a choice. If the input is not in the range 1-3, the
program should show an appropriate message and repeat the menu and prompt.

- If the input was either 1 or 2, then a valid function was chosen. The program should prompt for
the rightmost x value of the desired region (a float). You may assume that the leftmost x is always
0. Finally, the desired Ç« should be entered (a float).

- Once the solution has been found, the whole process should repeat.
